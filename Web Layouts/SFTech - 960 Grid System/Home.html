			<h3>History of Cebu</h3>
			<p>Cebu is a province in the Philippines consisting of the Cebu Island and many other surrounding islands. It derived its name from the word “SEBU” meaning animal fat. It is known to be a fishing village before the Spaniards came but became industrialized through the years. It is now one of the most developed provinces in the Philippines, with Cebu City as the center of commerce and industry.</p>
			<p>Cebu City, the capital of Cebu, is considered to be the oldest city in the Philippines. It is also known as the oldest settlement established by the Spaniards in the country.</p>
			<p>Found in the island are rich traces of the Philippine history left by mostly the Spaniards. Among these historical sites are the Magellan’s Cross found in downtown Cebu (a Christian cross planted by the Portuguese and Spanish explorers as ordered by Ferdinand Magellan upon arriving in Cebu on April 1521), the Lapu-Lapu Shrine (a 20-meter statue found in Mactan erected in honor of Datu Lapu-Lapu, a native leader who instituted the death of Magellan), the Colon Street (the oldest and the shortest national road in the Philippines), the Fort San Pedro (the oldest military defence structure built by the Spanish and indigenous
			Cebuano labourers under the command of Miguel Lopez de Legazpi), etc.</p>
